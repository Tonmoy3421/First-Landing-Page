            <div id="left-line-1" class="advantage-box">
            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p>I have a strong academic background with a perfect GPA in SSC and HSC, demonstrating dedication and intellectual capability. My passion for Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) drives me to develop skills in web development. As a former BNCC cadet, I have gained discipline, leadership, and teamwork skills.

            <div id="left-line-2" class="dis-advantage-box">
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2> 
            <p>Despite my strong academic background and aspirations, I recognize certain challenges that I need to overcome for personal and professional growth. I sometimes struggle with procrastination, especially on social media, which affects my productivity and time management. Additionally, I tend to overthink and daydream, which can distract me from focusing on my studies and responsibilities. Mathematics has been a particular weakness for me, requiring extra effort to master. Moreover, as I prepare for international education, I am aware of the cultural and social adjustments I may need to make while adapting to a new environment. However, I am committed to addressing these challenges through self-discipline, continuous learning, and effective time management to achieve my goals.</p>
